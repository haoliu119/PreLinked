PreLinked
=========

This is a 2 week group project with a team of four: *me*, [Stephen](https://github.com/sportanova), [Barry](https://github.com/barrymwong), and [Shao](https://github.com/shaohua) 
Here's a sample list of my personal contributions to the codebase:
 * Back-end work:
   * [LinkedIn API model](https://github.com/haoliu119/PreLinked/blob/master/backend/models/linkedin_api.js) 
 * Front-end work:
   * [Search Result View](https://github.com/haoliu119/PreLinked/blob/master/app/scripts/views/search.js)

> PreLinked combines the job search features of Indeed.com, with the power of your LinkedIn network to show you the best people to contact for the job. http://prelinked.jit.su/

### Don't Be Just Another Resume. Get PreLinked

Finding a job is tough, and can make you feel like just another piece of paper in a sea of resumes. 
Knowing someone at a company dramatically increase your chances of getting an interview, but until Prelinked, figuring
out what companies were hiring AND finding the decision makers could be a daunting task.
